![App Screenshot](/src/assets/Screenshot2019-11-01.png)


I completed this project to give the [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io) facilitators an understanding of my abilities as a developer who is about to join the next Chingu Voyage 13. Ultimately it will help them to create balanced, remote teams of developers for our upcoming 8 week project.

## The App

This is a fully developed front-end clone of the Google Fonts home page: https://fonts.google.com 

The app was written using React and utilizes the [Google Fonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started) and the [Google Fonts Developer API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api).

Other implemented libraries include **Axios** for making the API call to Google, **React Helmet** for injecting code into the `<head>` element, and **Lodash** for adding a `debounce` function to the `onScroll` events.
